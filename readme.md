![separator](public/images/separator.jpg)

A starter for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) 
and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Pre-configured with absolute import, 
[TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), 
and some goodies.

## Quick Installation

```bash
d# Using Yarn is recomended
npx create-next-app myapp-name -e "https://github.com/riipandi/next-tailwind-starter"

# If you want to use npm instead
npx create-next-app myapp-name --use-npm -e "https://github.com/riipandi/next-tailwind-starter"
```

> Don't forget to change `myapp-name` with your real application name.
